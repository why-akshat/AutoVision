# Traffic_Sign_Recongnition

Project Title:
Traffic Sign Classification with Deep Learning

Description:
Welcome to the Traffic Sign Classification project! This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning model that can classify various traffic signs with high accuracy. Whether you're interested in computer vision, machine learning, or road safety, this project offers valuable insights and practical applications.

Key Features:

Training Script: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the training process of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on a traffic sign dataset with 47 different classes.

Model Evaluation: An evaluation of the model's performance, including accuracy metrics and visualizations of results.

Tkinter GUI: A Python script with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, allowing users to upload images of traffic signs for instant classification.

How to Use:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to train the traffic sign classification model.
Use the provided Python script to launch the GUI for model testing.
Dataset:
The project uses a traffic sign dataset, which includes various types of traffic signs collected from real-world scenarios.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Tkinter
scikit-learn
Pillow (PIL)
